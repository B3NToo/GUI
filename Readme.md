# ScriptStarter: The Script Starter GUI

Welcome to ScriptStarter, the ultimate Script Starter GUI! ðŸš€

Are you tired of running scripts from the command line like it's the Stone Age? Say no more! With ScriptStarter, starting your scripts has never been more stylish and fun!

## Features

- A sleek and dark-themed GUI powered by the amazing `customtkinter` library. It's like giving your scripts a brand new wardrobe!
- Start your script with a single click. No more manual typing and command-line mumbo-jumbo. We keep it simple and classy!
- Keep track of the script's running time with our built-in timer. It's like having your personal script stopwatch. We even throw in some minutes and seconds for that extra accuracy!
- Stop your script in its tracks. You're the boss here! Show those scripts who's in control. It's like hitting the brakes on a runaway train, but way cooler!

## Usage

1. Install the dependencies: `customtkinter`, `subprocess`, `time`, and `datetime`. We like to keep things fancy but lightweight!
2. Customize your script's path in the `start_script` method. Don't worry, we won't tell your script if you choose another path.
3. Launch the GUI and let the script-running party begin! Click the "Start" button to unleash the power of your script, and marvel at the timer as it counts the precious seconds.
4. When you're ready to say "That's enough, script!", simply click the "Stop" button. Your script will obediently bow down to your command.
